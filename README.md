# tikape-sql5

This project is the second half of a course project made in groups for "Tietokantojen perusteet" (Introduction to databases).

The goal of this assignment was to create an application that utilizes a database. We chose to make an archive for smoothie recipes with the base project that we were provided with.

The application was built with Java 8, JDBC, Spark, Thymeleaf.

The application contains separate pages for recipe index, ingredient index and statistics. With the application user can add and delete new smoothies and ingerdients, compose new recipes with them, and see how many recipes an ingredient is used in.
